## Technical Status

### Development Environment
- **Development Server**: Running successfully on localhost:3000
- **Build Process**: Production build completes without errors
- **Type Checking**: All TypeScript strict checks passing
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier configured and working
- **Database**: Prisma client generated and schema validated

### Testing Status
- **Test Configuration**: Jest and Playwright properly configured
- **Test Coverage**: Awaiting feature implementation to write tests
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow functional

### Performance Metrics
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with Next.js and Tailwind CSS v4
- **Font Loading**: Next.js font optimization implemented
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic with App Router
- **Image Optimization**: Patterns established, awaiting content

## Implementation Notes

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Tailwind CSS v4**: Using latest version with CSS variables approach
2. **Strict TypeScript**: Enabled `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
3. **CUID IDs**: Using CUID instead of UUID for database primary keys
4. **Centralized Error Handling**: Custom error classes with proper HTTP status codes
5. **Mobile-First Design**: All components designed with mobile-first responsive approach

### Database Design Decisions
- **Appointment Status Enum**: PENDING, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED, NO_SHOW
- **Soft Deletes**: Services can be deactivated rather than deleted
- **Flexible Contact**: Contact submissions can be linked to users or standalone
- **Blog Relationships**: Many-to-many relationship between posts and tags

### Security Considerations Implemented
- Input validation with Zod schemas on all forms
- TypeScript strict mode prevents many runtime errors
- Environment variable patterns established
- Error handling prevents information leakage

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Issues
*No known issues at this time*

### Technical Debt
- TODO: Add comprehensive test suite once features are implemented
- TODO: Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- TODO: Add database seeding scripts for development data
- TODO: Set up proper logging aggregation for production

## Development Metrics

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript Coverage**: 100% (strict mode enabled)
- **ESLint Issues**: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- **Test Coverage**: N/A (awaiting feature implementation)
- **Build Time**: ~12.5 seconds for production build

### File Structure
- **Components**: 6 components created (navigation, footer, sections)
- **Database Models**: 6 Prisma models with relationships
- **Utility Functions**: Error handling, logging, validation systems
- **Configuration Files**: 8 config files (Prettier, ESLint, Jest, Playwright, etc.)
